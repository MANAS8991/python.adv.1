    "The key concepts in Python's OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes: Classes are blueprints or templates for creating objects. They define the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects: Objects are instances of classes. They can hold data (attributes) and perform actions (methods) defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and related methods within a class. It allows for data hiding and abstraction, where the internal implementation details are hidden from the outside world, and only the necessary interface is exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes). The derived class inherits the attributes and methods of the base class, enabling code reuse and promoting a hierarchical organization of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides flexibility by allowing different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways, based on their specific implementation."

    "In Python, when an attribute is accessed on an object, the inheritance search follows a specific order known as the Method Resolution Order (MRO). The MRO determines where Python looks for the attribute if it's not found directly in the object's class. The inheritance search looks for an attribute in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "The object itself: Python first checks if the attribute is present in the object itself. If found, it is used, and the search ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object's class: If the attribute is not found in the object, Python looks for it in the object's class. If found, it is used, and the search ends.\n",

    "The superclass(es): If the attribute is not found in the object's class, Python continues searching in the superclass(es) in the order they are defined. The search proceeds recursively up the inheritance hierarchy until the attribute is found or the search reaches the topmost superclass (usually the base object class).\n",

    "Inherited interfaces: If the attribute is still not found, Python looks for it in any interfaces implemented by the object's class or its superclasses.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are the key aspects and purposes of the __init__ method:\n",

    "Initialization: The __init__ method initializes the attributes of an object by assigning values to them. It sets the initial state of the object when it is created. This is where you typically define and assign values to instance variables (attributes) specific to the object.\n",

    "Automatic Invocation: When you create an object from a class using the class name followed by parentheses, Python automatically calls the __init__ method for that object. The __init__ method is executed as part of the object creation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter Passing: The __init__ method accepts parameters that allow you to pass values from the object creation statement to the method. By convention, the first parameter is self, which represents the instance object being created. You can define additional parameters in the __init__ method to receive values that are required to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: The __init__ method provides an opportunity to customize the object creation process. You can perform additional operations, validations, or setup tasks within the __init__ method to ensure the object is properly initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional: The __init__ method is not mandatory in a class. If a class does not have an __init__ method, Python automatically provides a default one. However, defining an __init__ method allows you to control the initialization process and ensure the object is initialized according to your requirements."
